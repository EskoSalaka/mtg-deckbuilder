# mtg-deckbuilder

mtg-deckbuilder is a little online tool for deckbuilding similar to for example 
https://deckstats.net/deckbuilder/ or https://manastack.com/home. It is made purely for fun & practice
purposes.

The backend will be built as a REST API with Flask & SQLAlchemy relying on data from Scryfall. The frontend will be built 
React by basically consuming the API.

At this time, there is not much else to tell. The amount of features and tinkering will depend on the
amount of time i have available, but im hoping to accomplish at least a nice-looking app with basic
user support.
